    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <h3>RP Information Panel (Minecraft)</h3>
    <p>
      The RP Info Panel mod was my first foray into Java programming. It's
      written for the Forge modloader for Minecraft versions 1.19 and 1.20. You
      can find it on
      <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rp-info-panel"
        >Curseforge</a
      >
      and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/rp-info-panel">Modrinth</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Occult Underwriter</h3>
    <p>
      Occult Underwriter is a <i>Papers, Please</i> inspired game made in less
      than two weeks for the
      <a href="https://itch.io/jam/cosmichorrorsjam3">Cosmic Horrors Jam III</a
      >. You can find it on
      <a href="https://zonespace27.itch.io/occultunderwriter">Itch</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Rendering Engine (Vulkan)</h3>
    <p>
      I wrote a rudimentary rendering engine in C++ in order to learn how to use
      the Vulkan rendering API. It features importing model files, material
      support, and transparency. You can find it
      <a href="https://github.com/Zonespace27/vulkan-engine">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>UT: Instagib (Titanfall 2)</h3>
    <p>
      For fun, I wrote a mod for Titanfall 2 that recreates the famous "low
      gravity instagib" settings from Unreal Tournament. This required me to
      learn the Squirrel scripting language, which was certainly a fun
      challenge. You can find its Github page
      <a href="https://github.com/Zonespace27/UT-Instagib">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Corru.Observer Save Editor</h3>
    <p>
      I put together a browser-based save editor for the webgame corru.observer
      in a few hours. You can find it
      <a href="corrusave.html">here</a>.
