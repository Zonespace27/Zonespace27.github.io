            <summary>For those who don't know what Space Station 13 is:</summary>
            <p>Space Station 13 is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> game created over 18 years ago on the <a href="https://www.byond.com/">BYOND</a> game engine, featuring many branches and forks, meaning no two servers share the exact same experience.</p>
            <p>The general concept of the game is that you are on a space station (surprised?) set in the far future. This space station is also a complete hunk of garbage, only one disaster from being scrap metal. And disasters are happily provided by the many potential hostile entities operating on board, such as corporate traitors, wizards, nuclear deathsquads, and more.</p>
            <p>It's your job as part of the crew to keep the station working as long as possible, and just maybe live to see the end of the shift. Or maybe, you'll take the role of an antagonist, the driver of conflict and general Bad Things happening on and to the station.</p>

        This game has taken more time in my life than I'd like to admit, honestly.<br>
        However, calling it simply a "game" discounts quite a bit of what's kept me with it for so long. 

        <h3>Forks</h3>
        
        <p>
            There's a fork of Space Station 13 for everyone out there, somewhere. Thanks to the nature of open source, anyone is capable of making their own fork of a codebase if they so wish. And honestly, that's what's kept this game alive so long. If people don't like how one server's running things, they can fork and try to do better themselves.<br>
            I've found myself playing on many codebases throughout my time in this game, and so I feel compelled to share a bit about them.

            <h5><a href="https://goonhub.com/">Goonstation</a></h5>
            The very first fork I played on. It's a lot of goofy fun, which works well with its art style and overall tone. Very newbie-friendly, and I can certainly recommend trying it at least once, even if its code is extremely different to most other forks'.

            <h5><a href="https://tgstation13.org">/tg/Station</a></h5>
            Long gone from its 4chan /tg/ roots, /tg/station is generally known as one of the more popular forks of SS13, offering the "classic" experience intended for the game. Not to say that it lacks in content, however. /tg/ has one of the most active codebases of any fork, and is constantly adding new content.
        
            <h5><a href="https://cm-ss13.com/wiki/Main_Page">Colonial Marines 13</a></h5>
            CM13 is a truly unique codebase, lacking almost every core concept of SS13, even the space station. This fork takes the form of a TDM game set in the <i>Aliens</i> universe, where Colonial Marines are pitted against a Xenomorph infestation on a planet. While CM13 lacks in overall mechanics and a dynamic environment, it promotes teamwork and gives an experience few other servers provide.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        
        <p>
            The thing that's kept me around is <i>developing</i> for it. The ease of the language, Dream Maker, helped me truly learn and appreciate programming.<br>
            In the time since I've started, I've continued to play the game (albeit less than before I discovered coding) while also programming for it. This love for programming is what eventually made me a codebase maintainer for <a href="https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13">Colonial Marines 13</a>, a fork of Space Station 13.<br>
            A few notable things I've coded, across codebases:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/pull/1620">Porting SDQL2</a> (<a href="https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13">CM13</a>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/goonstation/goonstation/pull/6276">Nuclear Operative Commander Uplink</a> (<a href="https://github.com/goonstation/goonstation">Goonstation</a>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/goonstation/goonstation/pull/6094">Slasher Antagonist Role</a> (<a href="https://github.com/goonstation/goonstation">Goonstation</a>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg/pull/20257">Clockwork Cult</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg">Skyrat</a>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74690">Style Point System</a> (<a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation">/TG/station</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        

        In fact, that's a big part of what keeps this game alive. People who find their way to this game are able to code for it with an ease unparalleled by many modern languages. Of course, such simplicity has its drawbacks, but for new coders that's not an issue.<br>
        
        I'm not sure why I went ahead and wrote all this, but hey, thanks for reading my rambling about a passion of mine.
